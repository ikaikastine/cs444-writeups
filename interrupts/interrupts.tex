	\section*{Interrupts}
		Modern operating systems are complex beasts comprised of various functionality such as I/O, process scheduling, file systems, interrupts and synchronization.
	  In operating systems, an interrupt is a signal to the processor that is emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention.
		Interrupts are synchronous with respect to the current process meaning that interrupts can happen at any time.
		Most computers have many devices such as a keyboard, mouse, hard drive, printer and scanners plugged into them.
		These various devices all need to have access to the CPU, however we are unable to predict exactly when it will need that access.
		Because of this, modern operating systems contain interrupts, which are a way for the CPU to find out which devices need attention and when.
		Interrupts work by giving each device an interrupt line that it can use to signal the processor.
		When the interrupt is signaled, the processor executes a routine called an interrupt handler to deal with the interrupt.
		The benefit of interrupts is there is no overhead when there are no requests pending.
		Despite most operating systems using interrupts, their implementation for interrupts and interrupt handling differs between each operating system.

		FreeBSD follows the pattern of other multi-threaded Unix kernels and deals with interrupt handles by giving them their own thread context.
		Giving an interrupt handler it's own thread context allows for the interrupt handler to block on locks and are run at real-time kernel priority.
		In FreeBSD, the interrupt threads are referred to as heavyweight interrupt threads because switching to an interrupt thread involves a full context switch.
		Currently, the kernel in FreeBSD is preemptive, however they only preempt a kernel thread when they release a sleep mutex or when an interrupt comes in.
		Having a fully preemptive kernel is in the pipeline for the future FreeBSD kernel.
